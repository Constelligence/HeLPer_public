### Response 2

Jib stops refer to the mechanical devices or safety features installed on tower cranes to prevent them from moving unintentionally or exceeding their maximum operating range. These devices are critical in ensuring safe crane operations and preventing accidents.

The lifting capacity of a tower crane depends on the distance that the jib can reach, making it more appropriate to describe the lifting capacity of a tower crane in terms of the jib-end capacity (i.e., the lifting capacity at the maximum reach of the hook block from the center of the tower mast).

There are two main types of cranes involved: tower cranes and mobile cranes. Tower cranes typically have counterweights, gearboxes, hydraulic cylinders, and various mounting points for parts of a crane system, as shown in Figure 7. Mobile cranes also use these components to stabilize their boom.

To ensure safe lifting operations, it is essential for crane operators and site managers to understand the specific characteristics and limitations of their tower cranes' jib stops. This includes knowing how to operate controls, using automatic safe load indicators, brakes, cabins for operators, guards, protective structures, electrical supply, equipment, limiting switches, travel limit switches, sand-boxes, and stops.

The stops should be positioned in a way that reduces the crane's traveling inertia in case it over-runs the switches. They should also be placed at a distance of half the crane base from the ends of the track to prevent exceeding the permissible ground bearing pressure beneath the ends of the track. On bad ground, longitudinal bearers can be used to minimize rail deflections.

Overall, jib stops are critical in preventing accidents and ensuring safe crane operations. By understanding their characteristics and limitations, operators and site managers can ensure that cranes operate within their safe operating range and prevent overloading or other safety hazards.

### Response 2

Proximity hazards refer to potential risks or dangers that can arise from the physical location and spatial arrangement of cranes in construction projects. In the context of crane sitting, proximity hazards involve the assessment of nearby obstacles, structures, power lines, and other equipment that could interfere with the safe operation of the crane or compromise its stability.

It is crucial for the Principal Contractor to arrange a risk assessment to be conducted by a safety professional before the commencement of any operation on tower cranes. This assessment should identify the hazards inherent in the operation and those which could result from adjacent activities. Registered Professional Engineers should be consulted on issues related to structural and mechanical stability, as well as issues related to the crane's siting arrangement.

The risk assessment should take into account factors such as ground conditions, soil bearing capacity, wind direction, and surrounding infrastructure. This proactive approach can help prevent accidents, reduce downtime, and enhance overall project efficiency. The Principal Contractor should formulate measures for avoiding the hazards identified in the risk assessment or where this is not possible, devise measures for minimizing their likelihood of occurrence or mitigating their consequences.

The risk assessment should be updated immediately before the start of operations to take into account any changes in circumstances. This will ensure that the crane is sited at a location that minimizes risks and maximizes visibility for operators, ultimately ensuring a safe and efficient operation.

### Response 3

Proximity hazards refer to potential dangers that can occur when a crane is situated near other obstacles or structures on a construction site. These hazards can arise from various factors, including but not limited to: (1) nearby power lines, transmission towers, or overhead cables; (2) adjacent buildings, bridges, or elevated walkways; (3) confined spaces or narrow corridors; and (4) other moving equipment or vehicles operating in close proximity.

To mitigate these risks, it is essential to conduct thorough site surveys and risk assessments before siting a crane. Additionally, regular monitoring of surrounding conditions and adjustments to crane settings or operations can help prevent accidents caused by proximity hazards.

Furthermore, research has shown that collision detection on construction sites is still in its infancy, and relevant strategies for addressing engineering problems specifically related to Crane-Laden Particles Pathways (CLPP) are reviewed in Sections 2.3 and 2.4 of a document. These strategies highlight the importance of effective communication and coordination between responsible persons on lifting operations.

In cases where two or more cranes are positioned in the same or different workplaces, risk of collision or rope entanglement can occur. In such situations, safety measures should be taken, including appointing a responsible person for overall control of the lifting operation, maintaining good communication and coordination between workplaces, ensuring crane operators have a clear view of overlapping zones, and providing an effective communicating system solely used by these cranes.

To further ensure safe operations, researchers have developed a layout optimization function to enable crane suppliers to drag and place tower cranes for equipment planning. An automatic feasibility checking function has also been created to examine the jib reach limit and loading capacity, which can be used to verify lifting plans.

By taking proactive measures to address these potential dangers, construction teams can significantly reduce the likelihood of incidents involving cranes on site.

## Query 16: What are the methods to employ height alteration of a tower crane?

**References:** LD (2011) Code of Practice for Safe Use of Tower Cranes

### Response 1

To employ height alteration of a tower crane, the owner should ensure that the operation is carried out under the supervision of a competent person, as per Regulation 7H of the LALGR. This individual should possess qualifications and experience in registering skilled workers in the trade of "To carry out erection, dismantling, telescoping/climbing of a tower crane, and the hoisting of materials, tools, and equipment related to the aforesaid work."

The crane's height alteration operations should be carried out within the specified limits, and if the desired height exceeds this limit, the tower should be securely anchored at the appropriate levels. It is essential to consult the crane manufacturer's instructions and follow established safety protocols when employing these methods to ensure safe operation and minimize risks.

Additionally, it is crucial to consider factors such as wind speed, load capacity, and ground conditions before making any adjustments to the crane's height or boom configuration. The lifting capacity of a tower crane depends on the distance that the jib can reach, hence, describing the lifting capacity in terms of the jib-end capacity is more accurate.

Some rail-mounted tower cranes may be used as static machines up to a specified height greater than their free-standing (travelling) height. In such cases, the wheels should be blocked in position on the rails and the travelling controls disconnected to ensure that at the increased height, they do not travel when handling a load.

It is also important to note that no part of any rails on which a crane is mounted or the sleepers supporting such rails shall be used as anchorage for the purpose of ensuring the stability of the crane.

### Response 2

The methods for employing height alteration of a tower crane include: (1) Following Regulation 7H of the LALGR, the owner should ensure that erection, dismantling, and height alteration operations are carried out under the supervision of a competent person. This individual should possess qualifications and experience in carrying out erection, dismantling, telescoping/climbing of a tower crane, and the hoisting of materials, tools, and equipment related to the aforesaid work. (2) A tower crane with a static base can be set at varying heights up to its maximum free-standing height. It can also be extended beyond this limit by tying the crane back to the supporting structure. However, rail-mounted tower cranes have a larger area of coverage as they can travel along their tracks carrying their rated loads, but the height requirement should not exceed the free-standing height as recommended by the manufacturer. On the other hand, mobile tower cranes offer great inward reach without the long jib that would normally be required to reach over the top of the structure. (3) For crawler cranes and track-mounted tower cranes, similar considerations apply regarding mobility and adjustability in height alteration operations. It is essential to follow manufacturer guidelines and industry standards when employing these methods to ensure safe and efficient height alteration operations.

Regarding lorry cranes, their safety operating load (S.O.L.) can vary depending on the orientation of the jib. Rapid rotating or over-extending the jib could decrease the S.O.L., making the crane unstable and potentially leading to an overturn. However, using a fly jib (a detachable jib) could increase the lifting distance; nevertheless, such modifications require reference to the manufacturer's manual and thorough examination by a competent examiner after installation.

### Response 3

There are several methods to employ height alteration of a tower crane, which can be categorized into two main approaches: top-slewing and luffing jib. Top-slewing involves rotating the entire crane around its vertical axis, while luffing jib refers to extending or retracting the boom in an inclined position.

In general, tower cranes are designed to be free-standing up to a specified height. If this height is to be exceeded, the tower of the crane should be securely anchored at the appropriate levels. Some rail-mounted tower cranes may be used as static machines up to a specified height which is greater than their free-standing (travelling) height.

The lifting capacity of a tower crane depends on the distance that the jib can reach. It is more appropriate to describe the lifting capacity of a tower crane in terms of the jib-end capacity, which is the lifting capacity at the maximum reach of the hook block from the center of the tower mast.

To ensure safe and efficient operation during height alteration procedures, it's essential to consult relevant industry standards and follow manufacturer guidelines. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provides guidelines for the safe use of tower cranes.

When employing height alteration, there are specific considerations that need to be taken into account, including ensuring proper counterbalance weights, maintaining correct boom angle, and implementing adequate safety measures to prevent accidents or damage to the crane or surrounding structures.

In some cases, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm may be proposed for operation strategy based on the parameters of the in-between edges. However, this should not be done without considering the specific requirements and conditions of the project, such as the height of all modules being 3150mm, thus h was assumed to be 4000mm.

In summary, there are various methods to employ height alteration of a tower crane, which depend on factors such as site conditions, lifting requirements, and operational constraints. It's essential to consult relevant industry standards and follow manufacturer guidelines to ensure safe and efficient operation during height alteration procedures.

## Query 20: What are the crane standing or supporting conditions of the sitting of mobile cranes?

**References:** LD (2017) Code of Practice for Safe Use of Mobile Cranes

### Response 1

The crane standing or supporting conditions of a mobile crane refer to the foundation and anchorage system that provides stability and support for the crane. These conditions are critical in ensuring safe operation and preventing accidents.

When setting up a mobile crane, particular attention should be paid to two factors: the crane standing or support conditions and the presence of proximity hazards. The crane's stabilizers or outriggers and jacks should be set before commencing erection or lifting operations. Crawler-mounted tower cranes require outriggers to be extended and jacks set when handling loads.

A firm, level base with adequate bearing capacity to support the maximum operating load is essential for good standing or supporting conditions. The crane's foundation or anchorage system should also have sufficient structural strength to withstand wind and other environmental loads. Proper drainage and protection from water and weather conditions are also crucial.

Mobile cranes must be properly selected to suit the job, taking into account their basic characteristics and operational requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements can lead to catastrophic consequences, including crane collapse or loss of control. Therefore, it is essential that all stakeholders involved in mobile crane operations prioritize the importance of proper standing or supporting conditions in their daily activities.

In general, crawler-mounted tower cranes do not have the same freedom of mobility as crawler-mounted mobile cranes and should be set firm and level when handling their rated safe working loads. Reference should be made to the crane specification and manufacturer regarding conditions under which these machines may travel in their erected state.

### Response 2

The crane standing or supporting conditions of the sitting of mobile cranes refer to the foundation and anchorage system that supports the weight of the crane, load, and environmental forces. These conditions are critical in ensuring the stability and safety of the crane operation.

According to industry standards and codes of practice, a suitable standing condition should be selected based on factors such as ground bearing capacity, soil type, wind speed, and seismic activity. The sitting of mobile cranes can be classified into three types: (1) static standing, where the crane is fixed to the ground; (2) semi-static standing, where the crane is supported by temporary or permanent foundations that can absorb some movement; and (3) dynamic standing, where the crane operates on wheels or tracks that allow for movement during operation.

Mobile cranes are typically constructed on static bases, which include in-situ base, on-own case, and climbing base. The in-situ base is mounted on special corner angles, frames, or an expandable tower section, cast into the concrete foundation block of the building as it is being constructed. The on-own base is mounted on its own base section or chassis, which sits on a concrete base with ballast. The climbing base is supported by the structure it is being used to construct, and to which it is attached by climbing frames and wedges.

The height of the crane can be extended as the height of the structure increases by means of climbing supports attached to the frames. Climbing support can be metal ladders, rods, or tubes. Tower cranes are also characterized according to their mounting configuration, which includes static bases, rail-mounted units, and mobile units.

Mobile cranes should not be used for piling operations, grabbing, magnet service, or any other duty that might impose excessive and/or indeterminate loading on the crane structure unless it is also designed for such operation. Working loads are often required to be reduced in accordance with the duty conditions of a mobile crane to be used for such duties.

Each type of standing condition requires specific design considerations, such as foundation depth, anchorages, and tie-downs, to ensure the crane remains stable and secure throughout its operational life. It is essential to consult relevant industry standards, conduct site-specific assessments, and engage with experienced professionals for guidance on selecting the most suitable standing condition for a mobile crane in operation.

### Response 3

The crane standing or supporting conditions of the sitting of mobile cranes refer to the foundation, anchorage, and support system that provides stability and prevents overturning or movement of the crane during operation. A well-planned and executed foundation design is critical for ensuring the safety and efficiency of mobile cranes.

Mobile cranes should only be operated on uniform, level, and firm ground with sufficient load-bearing capacity to withstand the maximum in-service loading of the crane. It is essential that the ground on which a crane stands has adequate bearing capacity, taking into account seasonal variations in ground conditions. The bearing capacity must not be exceeded under the most severe static and dynamic crane-loading conditions.

The siting of the crane should be certified by a safety supervision personnel, considering factors such as wind loading and dynamic effects. For mobile cranes, reference can be made to the Code of Practice on Wind Effects in Hong Kong - 2004 issued by the Buildings Department. Crane manufacturer's data relating to the deadweight of the mobile crane and the dynamic forces that occur during operation should always be obtained for determining the maximum in-service loadings.

In calculating the maximum bearing pressures of the crane on the ground or supporting surface, it is incorrect to assume an average value equal to total weight divided by the ground contact area. The maximum values would generally be far in excess of this average bearing pressure.

Adequate preparation of the ground surface for fixed tower cranes should be carried out for safety reasons. It is essential that the ground on which a tower crane stands has adequate bearing capacity, taking into account seasonal variations in ground conditions. The bearing capacity must not be exceeded under the most severe static and dynamic crane-loading conditions.

The siting of the crane, assessment of maximum loads, and design of foundations, supporting structures, and ancillary details should be certified by a safety supervision personnel.
