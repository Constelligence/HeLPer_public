Here's how it works:

1. Begin by forming a bight (a loop) in the rope.
2. Take the working end of the rope and pass it through the bight you just created.
3. Take the working end and wrap it around the standing part of the rope, creating a second loop.
4. Pass the working end back through both loops, from underneath.
5. Pull the knot tight to secure it.

The Double Wrap Choker Hitch has several advantages:

* It's easy to tie and untie.
* It's resistant to load-induced slippage.
* It can be used with a variety of rope materials, including static and dynamic ropes.
* It's suitable for use in high-impact situations, such as rock climbing or caving.

However, it's worth noting that this knot should only be used on a fixed anchor point, such as an inanimate object (e.g., a tree, post, or rock), rather than a person. If you're unsure about the best way to use the Double Wrap Choker Hitch, consult with an experienced outdoorsperson or instructor.

Regarding its usage, the Double Wrap Choker Hitch is generally suitable for lifting loads that are stable when suspended from a single lifting point (Document 8). It's also recommended to tie up composite loads securely at their ends by steel wires or similar means of adequate strength before using two-leg slings in choker hitch, basket hitch, double wrap choker hitch, or double wrap basket hitch (Documents 4 and 5).

In terms of lifting loads, the Double Wrap Choker Hitch is most effective when used with a suitable sling method that can grip the load securely. The included angle of the sling should not exceed 90 degrees, and it's recommended to connect a shackle to the sling legs before commencing the lift (Document 2).

### Response 3

The Double Wrap Choker Hitch is a type of knot that is commonly used for securing loads in various situations where a choker or slip knot might be less suitable. This method involves creating two loops with the rope, each wrapped around the standing part of the line.

The included angle of the sling should not exceed 90 degrees when using this method. It's worth noting that simple choker hitch or choker hitch double wrapped methods should not be used for handling composite loads such as loose bundles of tubes, or bars or wooden battens unless the friction grips between the parts are sufficient to prevent them slipping from the sling.

As far as possible, such composite loads should first be tied up securely at their ends by steel wires or similar means of adequate strength. The double wrapped choker hitch is generally more effective in securing loads compared to simple choker hitches, but it's essential to follow proper guidelines and precautions when using this method.

In terms of mechanical devices, the Double Wrap Choker Hitch can also refer to a type of coupling mechanism used in marine applications, such as attaching a shackle to a winch drum. This device consists of two overlapping metal straps with hooks at each end, one larger and the other smaller, designed to be tightened around a cylindrical object or shaft.

The maximum angle between the two overlapping straps should not exceed 109 degrees for proper alignment and securing of the hitch onto the cylindrical object or shaft. The illustration of this device shows a label indicating the maximum angle value, which is crucial for ensuring secure attachment and operation of the coupling mechanism.

## Query 14: What are Jib stops, what types of cranes are involved?

**References:** LD (2011) Code of Practice for Safe Use of Tower Cranes

### Response 1

Jib stops are a critical safety feature on certain types of tower cranes and other machines that involve a swinging or pivoting boom (jib). Here's a detailed overview:

**What are jib stops?**

Luffing jib tower cranes, like mobile cranes, require jib stops which will effectively prevent the jib from toppling or being pulled backwards over the tower. Jib stops should be designed to combine the functions of disengaging the jib hoist motor and physically stopping the jib as it reaches a predetermined position.

**Which cranes involve jib stops?**

The most common types of cranes that use jib stops are:

1. **Tower Cranes**: These are tall, stationary cranes with a jib (boom) that extends outward from the top of the tower. Tower cranes often have multiple sections or "spans" that allow for longer reach and higher lifting capacity.
2. **Mobile Telescoping Boom Cranes** (e.g., truck-mounted cranes): Some mobile telescoping boom cranes may use a jib stop, especially those with long booms.

In addition to the tower crane's own jib stop mechanism, there are also mechanisms in place to prevent conflicts between different tower cranes. When two or more tower cranes have their jibs overlapping, the mechanism will slow down and sound a warning when the jibs are 15 meters apart, and will stop operation when they are 10 meters apart.

In general, any crane that has a swinging or pivoting boom is likely to have some form of stop mechanism in place to prevent over-reach and maintain stability during operation.

### Response 2

In the context of lifting equipment and crane operations, "Jib stops" refer to a type of safety device used on cranes with jibs or boom systems. The primary purpose of a jib stop is to limit the horizontal reach (or extension) of the crane's jib, preventing it from extending too far out from its pivot point or striking an object that could cause damage.

Here are some details about the types of cranes typically involved and how Jib stops function:

### 1. **Crane Types Involvement:**
   - **Jib Cranes:** These are used in workshops, construction sites, and warehouses for lifting heavier loads with a shorter reach than tower cranes.
   - **Telescoping Boom Cranes:** Also known as hydraulic truck cranes, these can extend their boom length by sections that slide into each other to achieve greater height and distance.

### 2. **Function of Jib Stops:**
   - The primary function is safety—preventing overreaching or unintended extension beyond a certain point.
   - They are essential in tight spaces where there might not be enough clearance for the crane's jib to fully extend without striking something.
   - Modern cranes and lifting equipment often come equipped with advanced electronic or manual limit stops that can be set according to the specific requirements of the job.

### 3. **Types of Jib Stops:**
   - **Physical Stops:** These are typically metal bars or blocks attached at strategic points along the crane's jib or boom, which physically prevent it from extending beyond a certain point.
   - **Electronic Limit Devices (ELDs):** In more advanced cranes and lifting systems, electronic limit devices can be used. These sensors measure the position of the crane's components in real-time, automatically shutting off power to motors if the limits are reached.

In summary, Jib stops are crucial safety features for cranes with jibs or boom extensions, preventing accidents by limiting their reach. They come in various forms (physical and electronic) depending on the type of crane and its operational needs.

- *Processing time: 10.33s*

### Response 3

The term "jib stops" refers to a specific safety feature on certain types of cranes, particularly those with horizontal extensions that can be swung out for longer reach. Jib stops are most directly associated with preventing accidental movement of the crane's boom or extension, not necessarily just the jib.

To determine which type of cranes are involved, let's consider the relevant information from the documents. According to document 8.5.1, "Luffing jib tower cranes, like mobile cranes, require jib stops which will effectively prevent the jib from toppling or being pulled backwards over the tower." This suggests that luffing jib tower cranes and mobile cranes are involved.

Document 8.5.2 further clarifies that "The jib stop should be the type that combines the functions of disengaging the jib hoist motor and physically stopping the jib as it reaches a predetermined position." This indicates that the jib stop is a critical safety feature for these types of cranes.

In addition, document 8.8.1 states that "All tower cranes of every configuration must be equipped with built-in safety devices which operate automatically to prevent damage to the machine should the operator make an error." Specifically, it mentions that "luffing jib limit switches" are required for these types of cranes.

Lastly, document 9 provides a detailed schematic of a crane assembly or disassembly procedure, which includes a note stating that "BOOM STOPS MUST BE INSTALLED ON ALL BOOM SECTIONS AND BOLT LUFFING BOOM CRANES." This reinforces the information provided earlier and emphasizes the importance of safety features for certain types of cranes.

Based on this analysis, the type of cranes involved with jib stops are luffing jib tower cranes and mobile cranes. These cranes require specific safety features, including jib stops, to prevent accidental movement or damage to the machine.
